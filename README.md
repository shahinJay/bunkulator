# Bunkulator

Bunkulator is a tool that helps you calculate how many classes you can bunk, how many you should (considering you have an minimum attendence of 75%) and your current percentage. 

We do NOT encourage bunking your [valuable] classes.
(ps ofc those classes might be absolute shit but anyway you get my point)
